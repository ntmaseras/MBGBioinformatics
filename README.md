# Study of the role of RNA metabolism in tumours
This project aims to establish a map of genetic interactions focused on RNA-binding proteins and
RNA metabolism enzymes. This study involves a multi-step approach, starting from an extensive
review of the experimental and statistical methodology behind constructing gene dependency
scores, followed by an investigation into the use of gene-gene correlation scores to identify genetic
interactions. The project will leverage the data from DepMap, a genome-scale CRISPR screen, on
a panel of more than 800 cancer cell lines.
